===========================================

To run the tests, you need to have the supported versioning systems
installed: svn, hg (mercurial) and git.  There may be test failures
when you have different versions of these programs.  In that case,
please investigate as these may be genuine errors.

You also need setuptools or distribute in your system path.  This is
because we basically call 'sys.executable setup.py egg_info' directly
(in the tests and in the actual code), which will give an import error
on setuptools otherwise.  There is a branch with a hack that solves
this but it sounds too hacky.

For mercurial you may get test failures because of extra output like
this::

  No username found, using 'name@domain' instead.

To avoid this, create a file ~/.hgrc with something like this in it::

  [ui]
  username = Author Name <email@address.domain>
