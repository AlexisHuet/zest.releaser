Zest.releaser: easy releasing and tagging for Python packages
#############################################################

Make easy, quick and neat releases of your Python packages. You need to change
the version number, add a new heading in your changelog, record the release
date, svn/git/bzr/hg tag your project, perhaps upload it to
pypi... *zest.releaser* takes care of the boring bits for you.

Here's an overview of the documentation we have for you; after that you get a
quick intro on what zest.releaser does:
